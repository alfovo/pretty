Before our annual holiday party, my company LifeLink put on a hackathon to see what kind of fun or absurd new products we could design. My team won first place and \$200, which I used to buy a beautiful [Hungarian Kilim rug](https://mannrugs.com/). I was quite proud of the illustrations I made for our presentation.
